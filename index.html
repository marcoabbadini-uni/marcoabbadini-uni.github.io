							<h2>De Vries duality for closed relations between compact Hausdorff spaces</h2>
							<p>
								De Vries obtained a duality between the category KHaus
								of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous functions [de Vries, 1962]
								and the category of nowadays called de Vries algebras
								and certain functions between them.
								A drawback of the latter category is that composition of morphisms
								is not usual function composition.
								In a joint work with L. Carai and G. Bezhanishvili,
								we propose to work with
								The objects dual to compact Hausdorff spaces are nowadays called de Vries algebras.
								The morphisms that de Vries considered between these algebras are certain functions.
								consisting of objects so-called are de Vries algebras.
								The dual of KH is identified with the category of de Vries algebras and

							<h2>Positive MV-algebras</h2>
							<p>
								It is known that the
								{<font>&vee;</font>, <font>&wedge;</font>, 0, 1}-subreducts of Boolean algebras are bounded distributive lattices.
								<b>Positive MV-algebras</b> are defined as the
								{<font>&oplus;</font>, <font>&odot;</font>, <font>&vee;</font>, <font>&wedge;</font>, 0, 1}-subreducts of MV-algebras.
								In a sense, positive MV-algebras are to MV-algebras what bounded distributive lattices are to Boolean algebras.
								The class of MV-algebras is easily shown to be a quasivariety but not a variety.
								In a joint work with P. Jipsen, T. Kroupa and S. Vannucci, we find a <b>finite quasi-equational axiomatization</b> for this class.

							<h2>Equivalence à la Mundici for lattice-ordered monoids</h2>
							<p>
								I generalized a celebrated result by Mundici.
								This generalization states that the category of <b>unital commutative distributive lattice-ordered monoids</b>
								is <b>equivalent</b> to the category of what I called <b>MV-monoidal algebras</b>.
								Unital commutative distributive lattice-ordered monoids generalize Abelian lattice-ordered groups
								replacing ‘group’ by ‘monoid’.
								MV-monoidal algebras generalize MV-algebras, and they are described by
								a finite list of equations.

							<h2>PhD thesis <i>`On the axiomatisability of the dual of compact ordered spaces'</i></h2>
							<p><em>Date of defense: 9 April 2021</em>.</p>
							<p>
								In my PhD thesis, supervised by Prof. Vincenzo Marra,
								I presented a <b>duality</b> for the category of <b>Nachbin’s compact ordered spaces</b>,
								which are the partially-ordered version of compact Hausdorff spaces.
							</p>
							<p>
								In contrast to other known dualities for this category,
								the approach described in the thesis shows the dual of the category of compact ordered spaces to be equivalent
								to a <b>variety of algebras</b>—not finitary, but with operations of at most <b>countable arity</b>.
								This solves an open problem posed by D. Hofmann, R. Neves, and P. Nora (2018).
								In categorical terms: the opposite of the category of compact ordered spaces is monadic over Set;
								in particular, it is <b>Barr-exact</b>.
								As a consequence, one may note that also the categories of stably compact frames and of strong proximity lattices are Barr-exact.
							</p>
							<p>
								A further consequence is that also the category of <b>coalgebras</b> for the <b>lower Vietoris functor on compact ordered spaces</b>
								is <b>dually equivalent to a variety of algebras</b> with operations of at most countable arity;
								this strengthens a result of D. Hofmann, R. Neves and P. Nora (2018).
