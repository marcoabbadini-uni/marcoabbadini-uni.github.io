									Given a commutative distributive <font>&#8467;</font>-monoid <i>(M; <font>&vee;</font>, <font>&wedge;</font>, +, 0)</i>
									and an invertible element <i>u</i> <font>&#8805;</font> 0 in <i>M</i>,
									we equip the set of elements of <i>M</i> between 0 and <i>u</i> with the MV-flavored operations
									<font>&vee;</font>, <font>&wedge;</font>, <font>&oplus;</font>, <font>&odot;</font>, 0, 1.
									For the algebras arising in this manner, we provide an axiomatization that is both <em>equational</em> and <em>finite</em>,
									and we name these algebras <i>MV-monoidal algebras</i>.
								</p>
								<p>
									From a categorical perspective, we establish an adjunction that restricts to
									an equivalence between commutative distributive l-monoids with strong order-unit and MV-monoidal algebras.
									The equivalence can be further restricted to the celebrated equivalence
									between Abelian <font>&#8467;</font>-groups with strong order-unit and MV-algebras.

							<strong>Soft sheaf representations in Barr-exact categories</strong>.
							<br>
							
							<details>
								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									It has long been known that a key ingredient for a sheaf 
									representation of a universal algebra <i>A</i> consists 
									in a distributive lattice of commuting congruences on <i>A</i>. 
									The sheaf representations of universal algebras 
									(over stably compact spaces) that arise in this manner 
									have been recently characterised by Gehrke and van Gool 
									(J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 2018), who identified 
									the central role of the notion of <em>softness</em>. 
								</p>
								
								<p>									
									In this paper, we extend the scope of the theory 
									by replacing varieties of algebras with Barr-exact categories, 
									thus encompassing a number of ``non-algebraic'' examples. 
									Our approach is based on the notion of <em><i>K</i>-sheaf</em>: 
									intuitively, whereas sheaves are defined on open subsets, 
									<i>K</i>-sheaves are defined on compact ones. 
									Throughout, we consider sheaves on complete lattices 
									rather than spaces; this allows us to obtain point-free 
									versions of sheaf representations whereby spaces 
									are replaced with frames.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									These results are used to obtain sheaf representations 
									for the dual of the category of compact ordered spaces, 
									and to recover Banaschewski and Vermeulen's point-free 
									sheaf representation of commutative Gelfand rings 
									(Quaest. Math., 2011).

							<strong>Quantifier alternation depth in universal Boolean doctriness</strong>.
							<br>
							<details>
								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									In universal Boolean doctrines, by design, 
									there is no structure that allows one to identify 
									the quantifier depth of formulas, i.e.\ the level 
									of nesting of quantifiers. 
									For example, we don't have any information about 
									what formulas are considered to be quantifier-free. 
									In response to an invitation by M. Gehrke at the 
									conference Category Theory 20->21, we introduce 
									the notion of a quantifier-stratified universal 
									Boolean doctrine. 
									This notion requires additional structure 
									on a universal Boolean doctrine, 
									accounting for the <i>quantifier alternation depth</i>
									of formulas. 
									This is motivated by the extensive usage 
									of induction on the quantifier depth in 
									applications related to first-order logic.
								</p>

								<p>
									After proving that every Boolean doctrine 
									over a small base category admits a 
									quantifier completion, 
									we show how to freely add the first layer of 
									quantifier alternation depth to one such doctrine. 
									This amounts to a doctrinal generalization of 
									Herbrand's theorem in classical first-order logic. 
									To achieve this version of Herbrand's theorem, 
									we characterize, within the doctrinal setting, 
									the classes of quantifier-free formulas whose 
									universal closure is valid in some common model.

							<strong>An abstraction of the unit interval with Euclidean topology and denominators</strong>.
							<br>
							<details>
								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									Compact Hausdorff spaces are the topological abstraction of the unit
									interval [0,1] (in a sense that can be made precise). Let us now equip the
									unit interval with the "denominator map"  den: [0,1] -> N that maps a
									rational number to its denominator and an irrational number to 0. We
									characterize the abstraction of [0,1] that takes into account both the
									topology and the denominator map.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									(The reason why we were interested in this problem is that 
									we could show that the resulting 
									structures form a category that is categorically dual to
									the category of archimedean metrically complete Abelian 
									lattice-ordered groups.)
								</p>
								
								<p>
									This is a joint work with V. Marra and L. Spada.

							<strong>Positive MV-algebras</strong>.
							<br>
							<details>
								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									MV-algebras extend the theory of Boolean algebras by replacing the 
									two-element set of truth values {0,1} with the unit interval [0,1].
									They provide the algebraic semantics of Lukasiewicz many-valued logic. 
									Inspired by the extensive study of bounded distributive lattices, 
									which are the negation-free subreducts of Boolean algebras, 
									we aim to develop the theory of the negation-free subreducts of MV-algebras,
									called positive MV-algebras. 
									These algebras can be thought of as the many-valued version of bounded 
									distributive lattices. We axiomatize positive MV-algebras via finitely 
									many quasi-equations. Moreover, generalizing Mundici's celebrated 
									equivalence for MV-algebras [4], we obtain a categorical equivalence 
									between positive MV-algebras and certain lattice-ordered monoids with units. 
									We provide some results that can help to develop the theory of these algebras: 
									in particular, we exhibit a finite quasi-equational axiomatization 
									for the class of positive MV-algebras and a categorical equivalence 
									with certain lattice-ordered monoids with units.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									This talk is based on [1], [2], and a joint work with

							<strong>Unique embeddability property</strong>.

							<details>
								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									It is well-known that every cancellative commutative monoid <i>M</i> 
									can be embedded in an abelian group <i>G</i>
									(think of the embedding of <font>&#8469;</font> into <font>&#8484;</font>, for example), 
									and one such embedding is essentially unique 
									(if I embed <font>&#8469;</font> into any abelian group, the group generated 
									by the image will be isomorphic to <font>&#8484;</font>). 
									Something different happens 
									when we remove the hypothesis of commutativity: a cancellative monoid
									admits non-isomorphic group envelopes. 
									A similar phenomenon occurs in various algebraic structures close 
									to logicians' hearts (such as bounded distributive lattices and Boolean algebras).
								</p>
								<p>
									We give a characterisation of the algebraic structures that satisfy this unique embeddability property.

								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									Compact Hausdorff spaces are the topological abstraction of the unit
									interval [0,1] (in a sense that can be made precise). Let us now equip the
									unit interval with the "denominator map"  den: [0,1] -> N that maps a
									rational number to its denominator and an irrational number to 0. We
									characterize the abstraction of [0,1] that takes into account both the
									topology and the denominator map.

									lattice-ordered groups, generalizing a result of M.H. Stone (1941).)

							<strong>A generalization of de Vries duality to closed relations between compact Hausdorff spaces</strong>.
							<br>
							<details>
								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									De Vries (1962) obtained a categorical duality for the category KHaus 
									of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous functions. 
									The objects of the dual category DeV are complete boolean algebras 
									equipped with a proximity relation, known as de Vries algebras, 
									and the morphisms are functions satisfying certain conditions. 
									One drawback of DeV is that composition of morphisms is not usual function composition.
								</p>
								<p>
									We propose an alternative approach, 
									where morphisms between de Vries algebras are certain relations and composition 
									of morphisms is usual relation composition. 
									This gives a solution to the aforementioned drawback of DeV. 
									The usage of relations as morphisms between de Vries algebras allows us to extend 
									De Vries duality to a duality for the larger category of compact Hausdorff spaces 
									and closed relations, solving a problem raised by 
									G. Bezhanishvili, D. Gabelaia, J. Harding, and M. Jibladze (2019).
								</p>
								<p>
									I will discuss the strong connections with the literature on domain theory, 
									in particular with the notions of R-structures, information systems and abstract bases 
									(Smyth, Scott, Abramsky, Jung, Vickers), and with other duality theoretical results 
									(Jung, Sünderhauf, Kegelmann, Moshier).

							<strong>A generalization of the De Vries duality to compact Hausdorff spaces with closed relations</strong>.
							<br>
							<details>
								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									Stone’s representation theorem for Boolean algebras
									gives a bridge between algebra and topology in the form of a categorical duality.
									In his PhD thesis, de Vries generalized this duality to a duality
									between compact Hausdorff spaces and what are nowadays called de Vries algebras,
									which are structures that encode the set of regular open sets of a given compact Hausdorff space.
									One drawback of the category of de Vries algebras is that
									the composition of morphisms is not function composition.
									We propose to work with relations (rather than functions)
									as morphisms between de Vries algebras: this has the advantage
									that the composition of morphisms is usual relation composition.
									Moreover, this approach allows for an extension of de Vries duality
									to a duality for the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and closed relations between them.

								<p>
									Given an equational class of algebras (such as groups, Boolean algebras, etc.),
									and a fixed sublanguage of this class (such as monoid operations, lattice operations, etc.),
									we can show the equivalence of two properties.
									The first, which is called free extension property, is more semantic:
									it concerns extensions of certain partial functions to homomorphisms.
									Whereas the second, called expressibility of equations,
									is concerned with terms and identities, thus being more syntactic.

									The Boolean terms that are order-preserving in each argument
									(when thought of as functions from {0,1}<sup>n</sup> to {0,1})
									are precisely those expressible in the signature {∨, ∧, 0, 1}.
									It is known that the subreducts of Boolean algebras with respect
									to the signature {∨, ∧, 0, 1} are precisely the bounded distributive lattices.
								</p>
								<p>
									We make a similar investigation replacing Boolean algebras by MV-algebras
									- the structures that provide the algebraic semantics of Łukasiewicz logic.
									The MV-terms that are order-preserving in each argument
									(when thought of as functions from [0,1]<sup>n</sup> to [0,1])
									are precisely those expressible in the signature {⊕, ⊙, ∨, ∧, 0, 1}.
									In this talk we address the following question:
								</p>
								<p>
									Is there a nice axiomatization of the subreducts of MV-algebras
									with respect to the signature {⊕, ⊙, ∨, ∧, 0, 1}?
								</p>
								<p>
									We explain why an equational axiomatization is not possible,
									and we provide a finite quasi-equational one.
									To obtain this axiomatization we rely on a generalization of a theorem by Mundici
									connecting unital Abelian lattice-ordered groups and MV-algebras.

							<strong>Is the category of locally finite MV‑algebras equivalent to an equational class?</strong>
							<br>
							<details>
								<summary><span>Abstract</span></summary>
								<p>
									Locally finite MV-algebras form a subclass of MV-algebras which is closed under
									homomorphic images, subalgebras, and finite products, but not under arbitrary ones.
									However, the category of locally finite MV-algebras with homomorphisms
									has arbitrary products in the classical categorical sense.
									Driven by these considerations, D. Mundici posed the following question:
								</p>
								<p>
									Is the category of locally finite MV-algebras equivalent to an equational class?
									(D. Mundici. Advanced  Lukasiewicz calculus. Trends in Logic Vol. 35. Springer 2011, p. 235, problem 3.)
								</p>
								<p>
									We answer this question.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our proofs rest upon the duality between locally finite MV-algebras and multisets established by
									R. Cignoli, E. J. Dubuc, and D. Mundici, and categorical characterizations of varieties established
									by J. Duskin, F. W. Lawvere, and others.
